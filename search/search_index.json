This drives the cost down without compromising on functionality and quality.</li> <li><code>DIY</code> - Easy to build, no need for special tools or skills. If you buy our kit you don't even need to have a 3D printer and soldering iron.</li> <li><code>Open source</code> - All the resources are provided for free under open source license, including 3D models, code and even PCB files.</li> <li><code>Community Driven</code> - While this project is great for complete beginners, due to it's open source nature advanced users are welcome to make improvements, add-ons or adjustments and share them with the community. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#specifications","title":"Specifications:","text":"<ul> <li> 290mm diameter.</li> <li> 2 X 6 Digit Segment displays</li> <li> 8 Standalone Buttons</li> <li> 2 X Rotary Encoders (With push button functionality)</li> <li> 2 X Thumb Encoders  (With push button funcionality)</li> <li> 2 X Funky (7 way)  Switches</li> <li> 16 RGB Leds</li> <li> 2 X Magnetic shifters</li> <li> 2 X Clutches (with hall sensors)</li> <li> SimHub Compatible</li> <li> Compatible with 70mm Quick-Release systems</li> </ul>"},{"location":"part-list/","title":"Part List","text":"<p>This page provides all the details about the parts and component you will need to build the wheel.</p>"},{"location":"part-list/#parts-kit","title":"Parts KIT","text":"<p>Support the project</p> <p>This project is 100% open source and all the information is provided for free.</p> <p>Thousands of hours were invested into this project, please consider supporting it by purchasing the parts kit from us.</p> <p>While you can source and print all the parts youself , you can enjoy the following benefits while purchasing a kit from us:</p> <ul> <li> Cheaper than buying all the parts yourself</li> <li> No 3D printer required -
